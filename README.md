This is the site for the Dart Cookbook project.

The Dart Cookbook is being authored by Shailen Tuli.

An very preliminary (ALPHA -) HTML version of this book is online:

http://www.dartlang.org/docs/cookbook/

The book can also be read by viewing the book.asciidoc file on Github.
Recipes are generally created in branches (strings, testing, json, etc.)
and are merged into master from time to time.

And yes, everything is tested. Take a look at the test/ folder and you'll find
tests for the code that shows up in the recipes. Again, look in the individual
branches as the contents there are more likely to be up to date.

The Dart Cookbook is scheduled for publication by O'Reilly.
